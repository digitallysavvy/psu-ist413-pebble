Background

Semester long project for Penn State's IST 413. Project space had a focus in safety and using technology to help in emergency situations.


Application concept

The core concept of the application is to improve the safety of people walking alone in the late evening hours. The idea stems from Penn State being a large rural campus with many dimly lit walkways at night. There are very few people walking around in the evening hours which poses a security risk to anyone walking alone.

Users of the Pebble watch app will be able to read campus alerts pushed through the PSU Alerts RSS feed. The app will monitor rate of movement to determine if user is in danger. If user quickened their pace of movement at a late hour this could indicate that they are fleeing from a possible attacker. Pebble app allows user to call 911 with two button presses on their watch. The demographic for this app would include students or staff on a college campus. The app could ideally target students, staff, or civilians walking alone on campus late at night. It could potentially be integrated with the existing big, red panic buttons located within the Blue Light call emergency stations that are scattered around campus.
